Khoobsurat Hai
Yeh din mila,
Aa tu bhi mujhse mil
Mere paas aa,
Bas tu aur main ho rey..

Intezar kare mere dil ke khali kamre..

Tu aaye toh dhadkan badh jati hai,
Phir jaye toh mujhko satati hai,
O bekhabar sach karde sare sapne..

Rakhle sar mere seene pe tu,
Aaja akele main aur bas tu rahe..

Yeh jism tera,
Meri jannat..
Badan yeh tera,
Meri hazrat..

Choo loon tujhe tar jaun main,
Kitni tu khoobsurat hai..

Sareaam main haan kardu yeh elaan,
Haan tujhse hi krta hoon main toh pyaar
O besabar milne ko tarsa yun main

Jab hath mein tera woh hath ho,
Aur tu mere bilkul hi paas ho,
Tere hotho pe chalde yun labh yeh mere,

Likhoon aa tujhko main phir se,
Sarahun teri adao ko main,
Phir se..

Yeh jism tera,
Meri jannat..
Badan yeh tera,
Meri hazrat..

Choo loon tujhe tar jaun main,
Kitni tu khoobsurat hai..
