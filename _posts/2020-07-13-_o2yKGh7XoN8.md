Photographer
A photographer is a person who makes photographs. An amateur photographer takes snapshots for pleasure to remember events, places, or friends with no intention of selling the images to others. A professional photographer is likely to take photographs for a session and image purchase fee, by salary, or through the display, resale, or use of those photographs. A professional photographer may be an employee, for example of a newspaper, or may contract to cover a particular planned event such as a wedding or graduation or to illustrate an advertisement. Others, like fine art photographers, are freelancers, first making an image and then licensing or making printed copies of it for sale or display.
