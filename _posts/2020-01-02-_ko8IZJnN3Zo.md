Rehnuma
Aadat itni khushiyo ki na mujhko,
Barsaat itni khushiyo ki kyun kari?
Tere jaane se mere aane tak,
Tere rukne se mere aane tak,

Tu wahin rahi..
Tu wahin rahi..

O Rehnuma
O Satthiya
Husn tera koi ada

Rehnuma O dilruba
Main tera hua
Main tera hua x2

Kyun aayi hai tu?
Kyun aana tha tujhe?
Kyun ja rahi hai ab?
Kyun jana hai tujhe?
x2

Yahin rukja,
Yahi rukja..
Dil ke darwazo mein,
Kahin chup ja..


O Rehnuma
O Satthiya
Husn tera koi ada

Rehnuma O dilruba
Main tera hua
Main tera hua x2

Jo Yeh nasha chal raha hai tere aane se,
Mera shayad waqt accha chal raha hai..

O Rehnuma
O Satthiya
Husn tera koi ada

Rehnuma O dilruba
Main tera hua
Main tera hua x2
