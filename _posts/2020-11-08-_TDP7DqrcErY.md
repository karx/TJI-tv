Here's why: \nConvenience – Transform water into Soda, Sparkling Water & Soft Drink at home, in a few seconds, without using electricity or battery. Choose the strength of fizz, according to your preference. No need to store bottles/cartons of soda (and empty bottles) at your premises.\nHygiene, Health & Wellness – Use fresh water from home to prepare Soda. PET bottle or glass bottle Soda bought from outside does not have health certification, and hence the source of water is unknown. Avoid using bottles touched by many hands.\nEnvironment Friendly – Reduce the plastic waste generated at home by using the re-usable bottles that come with the Soda maker.\nSave Money– Make 1 Litre of Soda /Sparkling water for just Rs. 5 as compared to Rs.25 for 1L PET soda. Save heaps of money\n\nTired of pairing your tea with the same samosas & bread pakoras?
