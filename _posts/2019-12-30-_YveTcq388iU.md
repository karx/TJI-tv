Lyrics
Filhal toh oh yaara,

Kuch soch raha hoon main..
Yeh Ishq hai kya yaara?
Parakh raha hoon main

Naye hain is Shehar mein,
Tere dil ke..
Tu dikha de, tu sikha de..
Mohabbatein..

Dastur hai tu Ishq Ka,
Paar kara mujhe yeh Intehaan
Kuch door hai manzil abhi,
Tu sath chal ise asaan bana

O yaara..

Karar toh o yaara,
Un dilo ka hota hai,
Bichadna Jinhe kabhi,
Kahin na hota hai.

Sunta hoon jab awaazein is dil ki,
Tera hi naam aaye har baar,
Zubaan pe yaar..

Dastur hai tu Ishq Ka,
Paar kara mujhe yeh Intehaan
Kuch door hai manzil abhi,
Tu sath chal ise asaan bana

O yaara...
