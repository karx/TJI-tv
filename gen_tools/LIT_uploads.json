        "description": "All set to accept our Veg Chicken Nugget Burger Cooking Challenge?\nBlueTribe products are just a click away! http://rusk.tv/BlueTribe\n\nAs of late, there has been a lot of curiosity around “plant-based eating.” Plant-based eating doesn’t necessarily fall into categories like vegetarian or vegan.

This is where companies like BlueTribe Foods step in to make plant-based eating more quality-assured, enjoyable, and above all, accessible! By providing flavourful alternatives to meat products such as nuggets, kheema, etc., plant-based brands have taken a revolutionary approach in changing the way we look at meat. #chickenburger #vegburger #cookingchallenge\n\nIn the following video, we will have a #CookOff between plant-based chicken and regular chicken burger lovers.

        "description": "This week Cook Off brings you Dahi Ke Sholay Cooking Challenge straight from the INA Market, New Delhi. \nFor some amazing products visit: https://www.mrbutlers.com or Call: 18001031557\n\nFollow Mr. Butler on Instagram: https://instagram.com/mrbutler_sodamaker?igshid=c7h44qxcgf6e\nYouTube: https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCWD6Vp_Z0Zfr-SsqImsp4Xg/videos\nFacebook: https://m.facebook.com/mrbutlers/\n\nMr. Butler Sodamaker makes soda, soft drinks, and a whole lot of sense. Here's why: \nConvenience – Transform water into Soda, Sparkling Water & Soft Drink at home, in a few seconds, without using electricity or battery. Choose the strength of fizz, according to your preference. No need to store bottles/cartons of soda (and empty bottles) at your premises.\nHygiene, Health & Wellness – Use fresh water from home to prepare Soda. PET bottle or glass bottle Soda bought from outside does not have health certification, and hence the source of water is unknown. Avoid using bottles touched by many hands.\nEnvironment Friendly – Reduce the plastic waste generated at home by using the re-usable bottles that come with the Soda maker.\nSave Money– Make 1 Litre of Soda /Sparkling water for just Rs. 5 as compared to Rs.25 for 1L PET soda. Save heaps of money\n\nTired of pairing your tea with the same samosas & bread pakoras? Why not try these fried bread hung curd delights instead? #Dahikesholay, as it is commonly known, is gaining popularity across Delhi NCR. So, LIT here is with its brand-new episode feat. Rohit & Abhishek and of course fiery Dahi ke Sholay. If you happen to be a #streetfood lover, then you just cannot afford to miss this video.

        "description": "Click here: http://www.storytel.com/stories 👈 and avail 30 day free trial today!\nListen to thousands of audiobooks – everything from bestsellers to acclaimed thrillers, breathtaking novels, or weighty biographies.\n\nThe weekend is here friends and, so is LIT with a new cook off battle. What's the best way to enjoy weekends other than #junkfood! Isn't it? However, LIT always suggests you eat homemade and healthy food but, don't you think always eating healthy food is also boring at times? Cheat days are important as well guys.\n\nSo for this new cook off battle, Big Toss has started an ultimate war of junk food #vs #healthyfood between Rohit and Abhishek. Rohit being the chicken lover has decided to make chicken cutlets while Abhishek has planned to make delicious pancakes. But which dish will make Big Toss's weekend lit? Let's watch ahead this #cooking #challenge to find out!

Not just this but he is also into sports and fitness. This multi-talented Delhi guy has been featured in many shows like Challenge the Champions and Eattreat Challenge Accepted.\n\nAbhishek Thakur: Abhishek Thakur is an artist, model, and food enthusiast.

The only downside to cutlets is obviously the deep-frying part whereas a pancake is a more healthier option as they do not require much of oil to fry. India has many styles of pancakes. \n\nHealthy Food vs Junk Food\nJunk food vs healthy food are antagonistic and keep clashing with each other over nutrients and calories. Though we know healthy food is good for our body but then also we pick junk food if given a choice. Junk food which is rich in calories, fat, sugar and salt is much yummier and easier to prepare than healthy food. On the other hand health food like vegetables, fruits, lean meat, cereals and pulses contain plethora of nutrients. \n\nAbout LIT (Living In Trend)\n\nLiving in Trend is a non-fiction platform owned by Rusk Media Pvt Limited that covers all things Lit.

An amateur photographer takes snapshots for pleasure to remember events, places, or friends with no intention of selling the images to others. A professional photographer is likely to take photographs for a session and image purchase fee, by salary, or through the display, resale, or use of those photographs. A professional photographer may be an employee, for example of a newspaper, or may contract to cover a particular planned event such as a wedding or graduation or to illustrate an advertisement. Others, like fine art photographers, are freelancers, first making an image and then licensing or making printed copies of it for sale or display.",
