However, LIT always suggests you eat homemade and healthy food but, don't you think always eating healthy food is also boring at times? Cheat days are important as well guys.\n\nSo for this new cook off battle, Big Toss has started an ultimate war of junk food #vs #healthyfood between Rohit and Abhishek. Rohit being the chicken lover has decided to make chicken cutlets while Abhishek has planned to make delicious pancakes. But which dish will make Big Toss's weekend lit?

Not just this but he is also into sports and fitness. This multi-talented Delhi guy has been featured in many shows like Challenge the Champions and Eattreat Challenge Accepted.\n\nAbhishek Thakur: Abhishek Thakur is an artist, model, and food enthusiast.

The only downside to cutlets is obviously the deep-frying part whereas a pancake is a more healthier option as they do not require much of oil to fry. India has many styles of pancakes. \n\nHealthy Food vs Junk Food\nJunk food vs healthy food are antagonistic and keep clashing with each other over nutrients and calories. Though we know healthy food is good for our body but then also we pick junk food if given a choice. Junk food which is rich in calories, fat, sugar and salt is much yummier and easier to prepare than healthy food. On the other hand health food like vegetables, fruits, lean meat, cereals and pulses contain plethora of nutrients. \n\nAbout LIT (Living In Trend)\n\nLiving in Trend is a non-fiction platform owned by Rusk Media Pvt Limited that covers all things Lit.

An amateur photographer takes snapshots for pleasure to remember events, places, or friends with no intention of selling the images to others. A professional photographer is likely to take photographs for a session and image purchase fee, by salary, or through the display, resale, or use of those photographs. A professional photographer may be an employee, for example of a newspaper, or may contract to cover a particular planned event such as a wedding or graduation or to illustrate an advertisement. Others, like fine art photographers, are freelancers, first making an image and then licensing or making printed copies of it for sale or display.",

But why is there a misconception that makeovers MUST be expensive? After all, trips to hair/ nail salons, beauty spas are pretty costly. However, contrary to popular belief, putting effort into your looks does NOT require a lot of money. You can also go for budget makeovers without spending a lot of money.\n\nPalazzo Pants:\nPalazzo pants are long women's trousers cut with a loose, extremely wide leg that flares out from the waist. Palazzo pants are popular as a summer season style, as they are loose and tend to be flattering in light, flowing fabrics that are breathable in hot weather. Palazzo pants are less frequently seen during the winter months, but they may be found in wool or heavy synthetic fabrics as fine. quarantine outfits try on haul",

Pajamas and sweat pants are an example of lounge outfits. A lounge outfit is ideally supposed to be very comfortable with light fabric.

Lounge outfits like joggers and sweatshirts are perfect for Netflix sessions.\n\nBudget Makeover:\nMost people love the ideas of #budget makeover and looking more attractive after it.

The effects of these methods may not be as dramatic getting a full-body makeover immediately, but the long-term results will be more significant.",

Trendy outfits should combine comfort and fashion together. Every person can come up with some trends for outfits. Trends tend to change every season so one should not invest much as well. Trending outfits vary from every city to city as well. \nMost people love the ideas of #budget makeover and looking more attractive after it. But why is there a misconception that makeovers MUST be expensive? After all, trips to hair/ nail salons, beauty spas are pretty costly. However, contrary to popular belief, putting effort into your own looks does NOT require a lot of money. You can also go for budget makeovers without spending a lot of money. The effects of these methods may not be as dramatic getting a full-body makeover immediately, but the long-term results will definitely be more significant.\n\nThe key to pulling off a successful first date outfit is to strike a balance polished and relaxed. Your date outfit should aim for a lovely look that’s both feminine and chic. Give yourself the boost of confidence you need for the first meet-up with a classy satin date outfit that will make you feel like a super babe. While there are no strict rules for date outfits, most ladies aim for a chic yet casual aesthetic with clothes that are comfortable and fashionable.",
